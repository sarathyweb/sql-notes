- SQL is decorative language
- Primary key is used to uniquely identify a row in a SQL table
- Primary keys are usually sequentially generated using auto increment
- Foreign keys are used to link two tables using a primary key of one of those tables
<br />

- Numeric data types include bits, integers, floats, decimals and real numbers
- A Bit can be either 0 or 1
- Bit data type is usually used to set an attribute either true (1) or false (0)
- Integers doesn't have any decimal places
- Floats and decimals can have decimal precision
- Floats stores only the approximate value while decimal stores the exact same value
- Floats uses 32 bits while real uses 64 bits to represent a number
